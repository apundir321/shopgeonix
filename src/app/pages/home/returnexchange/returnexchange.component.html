                    <h1>Exchange</h1>

                    <p> Geonix’s 7-days exchange policy gives you an option to exchange items purchased from the website/m-site for any reason within 7 days of receipt of the item. We only ask that you don't use the product and preserve its original condition, tags, and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product, but please take adequate measures to preserve its condition.</p>

                    <p>Kindly note, all exchanges are subject to stock availability. Please also note that we only offer size exchanges. If you wish to exchange your item for an alternate product, we suggest that you return it to obtain store credit and purchase the new item separately.</p>

                    <p>The following EXCEPTIONS and RULES apply to our 7-days Return & Exchange Policy:</p>

                    <p>All items to be exchanged must be unused and should be in their original condition with all tags and packaging intact (e.g., shoes must be packed in the original shoe box).</p>

                    <p>We only accept exchanges for products purchased directly from Geonix’s website, mobile site. Any exchange request for products purchased from our indirect online and offline distributors will be declined by us.</p>

                    <p>Please note that we do not refund the shipping or COD charges incurred by you.</p>

                    <p>The exchange policy allows for only size exchanges.</p>

                    <p>If you self-ship your exchange, kindly pack the items securely to prevent any loss or damage during transit. For all self-shipped exchanges, we recommend you use a reliable courier service. A fixed amount of Rs. 100 will be reimbursed subject to the exchange having met our Returns and Exchange Policy.</p>

                    <p>Please check the items, type of exchange, and other related details carefully. Our courier partner will pick up only the items mentioned at the time of submitting the exchange request by you.</p>

                    <p>In case the items handed over to the courier person don't match the details of the items mentioned in the exchange request, we will conduct an internal probe and get back to you accordingly.</p>

                    <p>If you self-ship any product without officially informing us through our exchange process, we will not process the exchange.</p>
